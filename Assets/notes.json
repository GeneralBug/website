		"notes"		: "PIKMIN 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>So Pikmin 4. It is a video game that exists, apparently. Looking over my notes, I've noticed that most of them are generally negative, which would seem to give the impression that I don't like Pikmin 4, the real video game for the Nintendo Switch, but that couldn't be further from the truth. I would say this (Pikmin 4, actual Video Game that is Real) is among my favourite games, perhaps on a similar level to Pikmin 2, not that I'm generally one to try and arbitrarily rank things. But yeah, super good and awesome and you should by it if you're reading this within about a year of it's release to boost the sales numbers so they don't wait another ten years to make another one.<br><br>SO, I put this off for a bit because I wasn't sure how to do it so I'll just go through each bullet point as a bullet point and expand on it.<ul><li>SOUND: the environmental sounds are really great, especially stuff like mud and the clink of walking over the clay bridges and stuff. Lots of great ambience. However, I feel like the creature sounds got a bit of a downgrade. It's most noticeable on returning bosses, which can be directly compared to the GameCube games, but most creature sounds seem to go for a more \"realistic\" or \"authentic\" soundscape rather than the more expressive and \"cartoony\" sounds they used previously. I feel they loss a fair bit of their personality because of this, which is a shame. Also the music feels like it's generally going for more ambience rather than \"music\", similar to BOTW and TOTK; it feels mostly like forgettable background noise, where the previous games unquestionably have distinct \"soundtracks\", if that makes sense. That said, when they actually do do music, it's great; I especially liked the tracks used in Olimar's Shipwreck Tale. Speaking of which;<li>VARIETY: The game has HEAPS of different \"game modes\" that it regularly switches between to keep things fresh; there's the general overworld exploration with the day timer, the caves which are smaller and more focused (also love that they aren't all just procedurally generated jigsaw puzzles, probably one of the biggest sticking points with Pikmin 2), then there's the challenge mode caves which are just challenge/mission mode levels but sprinkled throughout the story to, as mentioned, add variety. There's the battle mode caves which are a bit less interesting, but it's nice how they act as a tutorial for that (also I understand why they're in split screen despite being against a CPU but it's still really annoying). The night missions are less interesting than I'd hoped, and Olimar's Shipwreck Tale is REALLY good; having a mini remake of Pikmin 1 is just super, DUPER cool and fun. I kind of wish that after unlocking them you could select them from the title screen to just play whenever though; Olimar's thing doesn't use any of your story equipment so that would be easy, and maybe have the challenge levels just give you an \"expected\" loadout like some games do for boss rush modes (e.g. DK64 or OOT3D).<li>SWARMING: okay, so a big complain by every single person with a brain that's played Pikmin 3 is the lack of c-stick swarming; the charge changes make in Deluxe were pretty good, but still not a complete substitute. In Pikmin 4, there's this guy that you unlock pretty early that sells you gear that unlocks various abilities and stuff, such as charging. I saw this, thought, \"oh that's a bit disappointing, but makes sense\", and moved on. Eventually I unlocked Shipwreck Tale, played to the second day, and WHAT DO I SEE BUT THE **LINEUP TRUMPET**???? An item that gives you SWARMING??? I was SHOCKED and ELATED and confused. Had I bought this from Russ without realising? Had I just missed it in the shop? I went and checked and no, it was nowhere to be seen. I NEEDED this item, so I looked it up. Turns out it's a quest reward for getting all the musical treasures; I had that quest, and was only missing a couple! So I check the location of the last few, and what do you know, the last one is in literally the final dungeon of the game. So they want you to go through the ENTIRE GAME without a CORE MECHANIC UNLOCKED????? I was shaken once again, horrified. If I was to get the most out of it, I would have to have rushed through the story and ignored all the side caves and treasures and stuff, which of course I didn't because anyone will tell you it's more efficient to 100% each area to avoid having to clear out all the enemies multiple times after they respawn! But it TURNS OUT they don't anyway so that was POINTLESS (which is also generally a bad thing since the areas quite quickly become really barren and lifeless, which just kind of feels bad). So the moral of the story is that you should rush the main quest to the final cave, get the the music box thing from the 4th floor or where ever it is, THEN go back and complete each area. Or just get a mod that unlocks it from the start, like it should be. Also having to hold L to use it wasn't ideal, but I think I mostly got used to it. Would be nice to have an option to swap that around with the camera controls. Speaking of which;<li>CONTROLS: the auto-lock-on is horrendous and it's baffling that you can't turn it off. It's sometimes helpful for just quickly dealing with random little enemies but it does far more harm than good; it regularly decides to target random other stuff around you when you're trying to kill and enemy or do some other time sensitive task. The controls from 3 Deluxe were quite good (despite the lack of swarm) and I'd say they should have not fixed what wasn't broken. The changes were likely in service of the new, generally lower camera angle. I was a bit worried when I first heard about it, but it was fine. Holding Y brings up a circle menu with various functions like items and dismissing. This is really shit. Luckily, however, you can map all these functions to the D-pad, so I did and never had to use that menu again; if that wasn't an option I think it would be enough of an issue to significantly take away from the game's quality. It would be nice to remap ALL the buttons, of course, but this is a Nintendo game, so we need to keep our expectations realistic.<li>TUTORIAL: is super long and slow; on a first playthrough I can understand but I dread having to go through all that again. Shame you can't skip it!<li>BALANCE: Oatchi, especially as the game progresses, gets SUPER overpowered. Combined with the power and ease of accessing items and ice pikmin existing, this game could be trivially easy if you don't restrict yourself. Now, this isn't inherently bad; easy games are accessible games, and nobody is forcing you to spam  sprays and lightning, but it's an interesting consideration. On my first run, I went for no deaths and no \"bought\" items (only the prototypes and those dropped from mound and stuff) and I found it to be a pretty reasonable balance, though still easier than the GameCube games. Maybe limiting ice pikmin usage and Oatchi upgrades would balance it out a little better too (though OP Oatchi is very fun to just ram into stuff and run around with). Also glow pikmin for caves are apparently completely broken but I never used any so I can't attest to that.</ul>Wow, that's really long. Pikmin 4 is great."

While I get it’s probably contradictory to their design goals, I felt the automation with the bee robots (which are also adorable) to be rather underwhelming and would have liked to see more.

I’d say there’s enough of an improvement from the Wii U version that you should play this one instead (though the old one is much cheaper, if you’re really desperate and strapped for cash. Again, it’s Pikmin, so it’s good). There are lots of control options in this one, which is always a pleasant surprise when Nintendo does it. Personally, I prefer a normal controller without gyro, but you should definitely try the different ways out. The changes to the charge mechanic (allowing you to charge your selected type in the direction you’re facing or at the thing you’re locked onto) make it better than the original, but it still doesn’t feel like it replaces the old swarm. The new side story stuff is nice, even if they are just glorified mission maps. The difficulty options are interesting, though even on Ultra-Spicy, I never had trouble doing everything I needed in reasonable time, and it’s still by far the easiest entry in the series. If you never played it on Wii U, definitely get this one, and if you did, get it if you really liked it and want more. Play the demo either way, just in case."

I’m struggling to articulate just how awesome this game is. The bosses are cool and interesting, the music is amazing, the treasures are cool and fun to collect. On that note, many of the treasures are product placement, like the Duracell battery you get on the first day, but I think this is actually kind of cool and gives a nice “grounding” in the post-apocalyptic setting (though it seemed like an odd choice; who is their target audience?). My only complaints are that some of the caves are a bit funky (why is there a perfectly preserved living room under this swamp?) and some mechanics are still a little scuffed, like Pikmin drinking nectar, or how you throw Pikmin with extra momentum when running but only sometimes. Overall, play Pikmin 2 now it’s amazing I swear."

I can only think of two parts that even approached that level of frustration, and both were postgame, completionist areas. A testament to the design is also that many parts that should be super shitty and annoying are somehow not, most notably the sheep herding (in the overworld areas) and the face puzzle things.

I’m not sure I can recommend it though, since it was far from perfect even at launch, and a lot of the shittier stuff has been exaggerated by age. The level scaling is terrible, with wild encounters capping at about level 30 outside of Victory Road and Mt. Silver (which you can only reach after beating the Kanto league), which making leveling up extremely grindy as the game goes on. Some of the mechanics are pretty fucked too, like only being able to carry 10 unique items in your main pocket, not being able to see what moves do without a wiki, and many of the day-of-the-week based events being tedious to reach. Also the roaming legendaries; wowsers. While great for its time and a massive step up from Red and Blue, I’d only suggest playing it today if you’re either nostalgic or curious. Play HG/SS instead."

It’s pretty repetitive, and can get quite grindy if you want all the best gear, but it annoys me far less than I expected. The core gameplay is just really fun. Early on, I had a bit of trouble with the controls, as my brain kept trying to think of it like Dark Souls, though it’s not similar beyond vague aesthetics (if that makes sense). On the topic of controls, they’re really weird and annoying, with far too many combinations doing various moves or controlling different menus and shit, and I wish there were a way to simplify it all; for example, by default, to scroll through items, you have to hold L and press the D-pad until you reach what you want, but that also brings up this action wheel thing controlled by the right stick, disabling camera controls (I’ve accidentally wasted potions with this thing far too many times). Crafting equipment is okay, though the menu for the smith is a bit obtuse, and it’s annoying that you can’t see what an item needs until you’ve “unlocked” it, meaning it’s hard to properly plan ahead. So basically, I like the game, but it has lots of little annoying things that don’t detract too much. Play it with friends."

Clearly very rushed, with bland graphics, non-existent challenge, basically no story (even by Pokémon standards), no postgame beside the DLC (which feels very tacked on), uninteresting gimmick, and of course, dexit.

I love the soccer-league aesthetic, but the gym challenges themselves feel completely detached from it, with only the leader battles even happening in the stadium. The wild area is a great idea, but they needed to go all-in and replace routes entirely; we just ended up with a big empty field with nothing to do, and bland, linear routes with no reason to ever return to. To me, it seems like Gamefreak really doesn’t want to make Pokémon games anymore, but can’t not, given how absurdly profitable they are. It’s just really disappointing. All that said, I still did enjoy the game quite a bit; it’s still Pokémon at the end of the day, and if you like the core gameplay, you’ll probably still have fun with it.

I think it’s not bad overall, but has lots of little things that feel annoying or unpolished, which remind me that I could be playing Starbound instead. Firstly, the difficulty spike after beating the Wall of Flesh felt very extreme; suddenly, all my cool gear is completely useless, monsters that can all but one-shot me are everywhere, and the corruption is immediately right on my doorstep. This isn’t an inherently bad idea, but I was unprepared and it felt quite unfair. Next, the inventory system feels weirdly cumbersome. It might be that the icons are too small, or they all look too indistinct from one another, I’m not really sure. It just feels off, somehow. I do greatly appreciate the quick stack button, though. Lastly is the crafting system, which is probably the worst implementation I’ve seen. So, crafting is in a small list bellow the inventory, and new recipes become available when you stand next to certain objects in the world (which can be literally anything). However, recipes only appear if you have all the required ingredients, and you can only check recipes by talking to the guide and placing an ingredient for that recipe in this little slot (that I never would have noticed had it not been pointed out to me). It’s really dumb and annoying, and usually requires me to have a wiki open on my second screen. All that said, I like the density of content and the concept of the boss system. The achievement telling you what to aim for next in the menu is also a great idea that helped me considerably. I definitely prefer Starbound though, as it does all the stuff I complained about far better, and has a few other advantages like nicer controls/”interaction systems” (placing tiles in the background, for example), and I prefer the more “firm” lore and the general concept of space exploration much more. I should also note that I haven’t tried mods yet, which could very well fix everything and make it amazing."

They also did away with the old durability, which is nice since it felt like a non-issue. My main complaint if the level design, with the map being extremely linear, to the point where it feels weird to even call it a Metroidvania. You get small clusters of connectedness within a given area, with single connections to each of the next parts. Having the ability to warp around between bonfires from the beginning, while convenient and nice, feels like it takes away a measure of connection to each area. I feel like I explore somewhere, reach the next bonfire, and never have any reason to go there again. These combined make the game feel more \"empty\", I suppose. Perhaps if you could only warp to specific bonfires? Also, bonfire placement is sometimes really weird. It felt quite generous, but often you’d get bonfires that felt right next to one another, especially the Dragonslayer Armour and Grand Archives bonfires, which are just comically close. Of course, all the other stuff is good; combat and visuals and bosses and all that are superb. ALSO, I found it odd that, as with to Dark Souls, the final boss was pretty underwhelming, considering the whole point is the big fancy hard bosses."

I only got stuck once; after the first bossfight, I couldn’t find the little hole in the wall and had to reference a walkthrough. I really like the simplicity of it, which reminded me a lot of Half-Life, as mentioned before. One odd thing was the crossbow, which allowed for a great deal of cheese (such as basically bypassing the horse boss) and making the soup work on bosses. The atmosphere was great, with some really good spooky sections."

I also got annoyed at times where I needed to do lots of backtracking, especially when you get into an area you can only leave from in a certain direction, forcing you to circle right around the entire map again, though the map being clear and showing stuff like breakable blocks and uncollected pickups helped considerably. I probably should have written this a month ago when I was playing the bulk of it, as I left it for a bit and only just came back to finish off the final boss."

When you think about it, these two projects are quite similar in concept; trying to translate a turn-based linear RPG adventure game into a more open and free-form one, but Pixelmon falls a bit flat in integrating the Pokémon meaningfully into the existing Minecraft gameplay and providing the player with any direction or incentives beyond “catch the cool thing you want”. PLA utilises Pokémon in all of it’s systems whoever, including resource collection and transport, as well as having goals beyond simply plot, making it far more compelling. Of course, they had the advantage of being about to design and build the game from scratch, but still. My main issues with PLA are;<ul><li>It’s very ugly in both execution and art direction, though that’s pretty par for the course when it comes to Pokémon<li>It got a bit grindy near the end, having to stand around waiting for space-time rifts to catch some of the rarer stuff like fossils, though this can be worked around with trading<li>Lack of meaningful multiplayer; literally only trading, though the bag recovery thing is a fun concept<li>Most of the menus have some sort of issue, like lack of sorting.

Also, and more substantially, the hitboxes for most stuff felt VERY janky.

I don’t like explaining basic game information in these generally, but given that I’m now publishing them and this is an obscure romhack, I will; this is a roguelite Pokemon game where you go through a Slay-the-Spire-esque map and go into encounters (routes, rest stops, trainer battles, etc.) and fight a gym leader at the end of each segment, then eventually the elite four and champion with your little Nuzlocke team. It’s quite hard, and I’ve have yet to reach the end, but quite fun. Each section has a level cap that you reach almost immediately so as to remove the need to grind, and healing (outside of healing rest stops) costs exponentially more each time you do before each \"boss\". The metaprogression is also interesting; as well as money for progress and achievements (of which there seem to be many) you eventually unlock the safari zone where you can catch anything you’ve caught previously, including a high shiny chance if you found a shiny in a run. You can only take one Pokemon into a run, which resets when you end a run (to the state it was in when you started, so you can still apply TMs and stuff in the hub). It also has lots of options which I didn’t fiddle with too much, but you seem to be able to customise it a lot."

This makes them still very useful in general and in niche situations (weight stuff), but not so powerful as to trivialise almost all combat like their vanilla counterparts. The \"trolling\" mechanic is also very interesting, more so than the vanilla flower system; the three stages of flower growth, which grant slightly better walk/carry speed and damage at each stage in vanilla are replaced with three new states. Normal leaf 🅱️ikmin, which are fast enough to keep up with you, the new \"bud\" stage of \"Sonic\" 🅱️ikmin, which as far as I know only improves carry speed, but by a ton, and \"trolled\" 🅱️ikmin, which are acquired the ways you would normally get flowers, are completely useless, being agonisingly slow and weak, and are given a really weird floaty throw arch. This incentivises plucking 🅱️ikmin quickly to avoid troll growth and turns nectar into an obstacle, and withering blowhogs (or whatever the equivalent was called in this) into a helpful utility. Overall, a very interesting take and worth a try, if you can stomach the Youtube poop."

Also an interesting note; one of the episodes of Masahiro Sakurai's little game design show talked about emphasising \"big moments\", such as the player dying. Here we see why that's important, because this game just cuts abruptly to a game over screen, usually leaving me wondering how I died.

Unlike previous \"remakes\", which are considered among the best games in the series, BDSP are more like glorified ports, with virtually no meaningful changes taken from Platinum and only a few meaningful differences to the originals, beside graphics (which are strangely just \"3D-ified\" versions of the original sprites). On a positive note; the changes to the underground are good, with the dens containing the only interesting geometry in the game, the massive speed issues were fixed (though you could argue that was carried over from Platinum), and the Pokémon league was actually really fun to fight with the increase in difficulty. The HM system is reasonable too. However, the cons far outweigh all of that. The National Dex is limited once again, though it excludes stuff like Sylveon and (I believe) regional forms, which is one of those things that feels like it is only like because of some misplaced dedication to preserving the originals (I’m surprised they even included Fairy typing). The team-wide EXP-share isn’t toggle-able, and affection (which would only \"need\" to be included to evolve Sylveon) is TIED TO FRIENDSHIP (this is dumb). Also, technical issues. The game features many soft-locks and duplication glitches, though I’ve been lucky enough to avoid them. The collision on lots of the geometry is just fucked; sometimes as a product of zealous adherence to the original tile-based layouts, and elsewhere (the underground dens) just actually fucked. The D-pad controls are also broken; they’ve obviously coded it using a flat if statement, as certain directions have clear priority over others, making it pretty much unusable for anything beside minor corrections around the aforementioned fucked collision. Also berry watering is broken, with random berries getting watered, but sometimes not, as they only appear watered, so you have to manually water each if you want proper yields, which is exacerbated by the removal of the original walking-sideways system. My theory is that Legends Arceus was originally intended to be the gen four remakes, but they got a bit carried away with it, but still wanted something, so they just pawned it off to ILCA, and maybe enforced strict creative limitations? It’d be interesting to know if the \"faithfulness\" was their idea or not. Now, having said all of that, I did still enjoy the game; at the end of the day, it’s still Pokémon. I understand Platinum is better than BDSP in basically every way, so play that instead. On a tangential note, I just realised that they stopped using the \"version\" sub-heading thing in gen 6."

Beside the obvious graphical and control changes made in the Switch port, a few mechanical changes were made with mixed results. Pikmin are generally more responsive, which is a very welcome change, though there are still times when they feel sluggish, like how they need to wait until an object is completely absorbed by the Onion before being commandable again. The changes to bomb rocks are interesting; they're generally much safer to handle now, with it being (maybe?) impossible to accidentally set one of randomly, provided there isn't a \"bomb rock target\" nearby. However, these changes also make them harder to actually use against enemies. I struggled against the final boss quite a bit because I just couldn't get it to swallow the rocks properly; the pikmin kept running around when thrown or just dropping them underneath it and running away. Also they'll return to you without doing anything if a different bomb pikmin has already been assigned to throw a rock at a given enemy, making bulborbs and bulbears quite annoying to fight with them. Unfortunately, pikmin pathing when following you still sucks, making it basically impossible to cross a bridge without a few just walking off the edge and drowning. Also the need to now hold L to swarm is kind of annoying; I somewhat got used to it in Pikmin 4, and I imagine I could in 1 too, but it feels like such an unnecessary change. At the very least, it would be nice to have the option to invert it, since literally the only time I touched the stick was to swarm. All that said, this is probably still technically the best version, unless you can't live without Wii controls."

You run around exploring, finding weapons and monsters and random little things, only to reach a comparatively boring shrine, or a divine beast which is just a bigger, fancier shrine, or a really underwhelming final boss. Tears of the Kingdom is more like 80% journey, 20% destination (give or take). The journey is part is really good, and possibly better, and the shrines feel *somewhat* better, I think (I haven't played BOTW since launch so I may be misremembering); the dungeons are certainly better, most notably having actually interesting and unique aesthetics and settings and maybe leaning into a central gimmick more (again, BOTW might also be like that and I just forgot because they felt so bland). Also, while the basic sequence of proper boss fight and big outside spectacle is reused here, it's executed far better than BOTW. Having a duel with actual, literal Ganondorf is much more interesting than fight a big amorphous tech homunculus, and the dragon thing actually has something to do with the rest of the game (also of note is that Ganondorf turning into a big spooky dragon would probably be more impactful if the main evil guy from the last game didn't spend the entire game as a big spooky dragon). On a more specific note, the stuff it does better:<ul><li>The component-gluing-vehicle thing. There is just something about making little cars and driving around that tickles some primal part of my brain in just the right way. Even when it's extremely impractical or I'll only use it for a minute or two, I just can't help it! I do think that they should have shown off the control stick in the tutorial somewhere though, since it would let players know that it exists and to look forward to it.<li>The underground, while lacking in variety, feels really interesting. The fact it isn't just a retextured overworld and has it's own unique mechanics and collectables and stuff helps that, and allows for you to mix things up a bit, which is cool. I also just like stuff there you need to play around with lights in dark places.<li>Weapon fusing feels like a nicer system than just finding fancy weapons laying around. For one, it allows for more variety and some experimentation (though there aren't too many unique things you can do with it, there seem to be enough, maybe). I also feel that sense of \"I have to save this for the right moment which never comes\" less with this system, since you pretty much always have some good materials you can throw out if you need them. Especially with arrows.</ul>Worse stuff:<ul><li>The setting/plot feels really convoluted and disjointed. It might not be so bad if you haven't played BOTW, and it wouldn't matter much if it wasn't positioned as a direct sequel, but I did and it is. Why is virtually all of the Sheikah stuff (both \"mobile\" like the dead guardians and divine beasts and \"stationary\" like the shrines, towers and ESPECIALLY the stasis chamber or whatever where Link was sleeping for 100 years which is just a normal cave now with no trace of anything??) is just gone without explanation? At first I thought it might have been some time-travel-history-changing stuff, but they do reference the divine beasts and Sheikah directly, and there's a little bit left in key areas. I get the non-diegetic reason; having one type of fancy ancient technology that isn't relevant to any of the new stuff would detract from the new fancy ancient technology, and also muddy the world design; they would need to use the existing towers or shrines for something, or clearly deemphasise their importance to the player in favour of the new towers and shrines and stuff. But still, even if they didn't want to do all that, all they would need is some throwaway line from Purah about how the towers all sank back into the ground or something, and the guardians are being salvaged for parts for the new towers. Yet they didn't! (unless I just missed it somewhere, but you'd think this would be an important enough point to make it hard to miss)<li>On a related note, the new Zonai stuff is dumb. Did they really need to make a new, different ancient technologically advanced civilization (Fun Fact: this is the third time in a row they've done it; fourth if you want to stretch it and call the twilight people \"technologically advanced\") with suspiciously similar technology to the Sheikah (beside the little vehicle bits)?<li>The sage follower guys, while conceptually interesting, are really annoying and badly implemented. Their active powers really should just be in the little menu thing so you don't constantly accidentally try to either explode or blow away the bug you're trying to catch, or ruin the car you just made. Also love when I'm trying to use one but they just run away from you because they think you're just walking in that direction. I'm grateful they at least made them silent so I wouldn't have to endure Yunobo for any longer than necessary. <li>No guardians :(</ul>As with BOTW, this is certainly not \"the best game ever made\" (or even the best Zelda) but it's still really good; better gameplay than BOTW but the disjointed narrative stuff brings it down, so maybe on-par overall?"

In regards to the Switch-specific changes, they're a mixed bag (I don't like that expression but I can't think of a better one). The gyro is kind of useless, as I find it mostly just makes the cursor wiggle off target rather than helping to aim. As I speculated in my Pikmin 1 write-up thing I got used to holding L for swarming, but I find myself basically always doing so; the only time I use the stick for the camera is for the pre-existing camera zooming function and by accident; really hoping they patch in an option for this. Also it's sad that you can only swarm (and thus make the funny little noises) when you have Pikmin with you now. The product placement being removed made literally zero difference; as a kid I didn't recognise most of the brands anyway as most of them were either American or European, so they may as well have been made up. I also retract my statement about grounding from the GameCube thing; that's really dumb and I'm not sure what I was thinking.<br><br>Also of note is that playing this one directly after 1 really highlights just how fucking stupid the Pikmin are in that game; it's so nice being able to do something as simple as just walk from one end of the map to the other without having to constantly babysit them at every little road bump, though that's more a criticism of 1 than praise of 2."

Your guys will automatically train themselves for tasks as needed rather than needing you to tell them to learn first.

Same with manually controlling lasers, or controlling individual miners for that matter.

First is a lack of \"highlight enemy range\" button found in (at least) the 3DS Fire Emblems; you can both press a button to toggle all enemy ranges in purple, as well as highlight specific units in red; here you can see a unit's range when hovering over them, and that's it. Second is a little nitpicky thing that I also got in the habit of from Fire Emblem; when you select a unit to move move it to another to attack it, it will just choose whichever tile is closest rather than the tile you moved your cursor in from, if that makes sense. Instead you have to move them to the tile you want, then select attack (bad). Finally is a general issue with this style of game, which Wargroove goesn't do anything to alleviate. It's extremely easy to get half an hour into a level, everythings going great, when suddenly enemy reinforcements spawn next to your commander and kill them in a single round, forcing you to restart completely. Or even just mispositioning them due to points 1 or 2, making them vulnerable to stuff they shouldn't be. It always feels really shitty and makes me not want to try again. "

Not having stuff locked behind classes was a very good call, especially since it wasn't super clear what some of them were in character creation, but respecing is easy. Gameplay wise I have a few complaints:<ul><li>The game doesn't autosave nearly enough, so you really need to get into the habit of quicksaving or risk having to redo a few combat encounters (why wouldn't it autosave when you leave combat?)<li>It's VERY easy to miss-input in combat; placing the cursor over an enemy can be finicky and pressing right on the D pad (which you'd do to navigate the hotbar) activates \"attack mode\" so it's easy to accidentally waste a bunch of action points just smacking the ground for no reason.<li>The default actions associated with some objects are baffling; I couldn't tell you how many times I've tried to open an oil barrel thinking it was a container only to pick it up because that's a thing literally anyone has ever wanted to do I guess? And when I go to drop it it assumes I want to CRAFT with it??<li>Not so much a complaint and I get why it's like it is but a part of me really wishes it was on a grid. Maybe I'm just too used to Fire Emblem and stuff<li>The quest journal sucks</ul>But yeah, it's pretty good. Also positioning is way more important than I expected it to be which is cool but also means literally everyone you enounter as some kind of teleport power and you're kind of fucked if you don't."

The puzzles were all a pretty good balance difficulty wise; I only got stuck enough to look up the solution once and it was super obvious once you see it. My only complaint is that the dialogue volumn is VERY loud and can't be adjusted separately, so I had to play the whole game with very quiet everything except talking. It's been too long since I played either vanilla game or some other mods to properly compare them. I found the opening \"tutorial\" section interesting, since it reintroduces most of the vanilla mechanics in rapid succession, clearly counting on the player to already be familiar with them; that's probably reasonable given that this is a mod, but interesting none the less. Also of note is that they used the \"despawning cubes to unpress buttons and stuff\" thing as an intended part of puzzles, which I only noticed because I saw a video talking about how it's used a lot in workshop levels but never in any vanilla puzzles."

Replenishing your consumables after enough deaths is also a very nice quality of life touch that I wouldn't have expected in a game from this time, but it definitely helps save on grinding that (at least I) would have needed to do at various points.<br><br>There are lots of very \"how would anyone figure this out without a walkthrough\" points though, like how to get the rocket launcher, which you need to kill a boss that isn't clearly indicated as being a boss and attacking them with it doesn't indicate that they're being hurt, unlike most other enemies.

Fewer weird little bullshit parts is quite nice (though not completely absent), though getting spotted felt a lot more fatal in this one.<br><br>The attention to detail is wonderful, in every regard. Especially the graphics though. Holy scabolly, does this game look nice. The stock footage used in some of the cutscenes look a bit out of place though, and it doesn't help that most of them are common enough that I immediately recognised them. <br><br>Also, on the subject of similarities, I found it interesting how many sequences and concepts were reused from Metal Gear 2, like the \"four dudes try to kill you in an elevator\" and \"the final section is behind a key that you need to change the temperature of\", and even \"fist fight the pilot after blowing up the big mech\", especially considering plot stuff."
