          <p>Well that sure took awhile. This entry marks the <em>actual</em> creation of my blog, which I've been procrastinating on for almost a year, apparently. Honestly the biggest thing was trying to think of a way to reconcile having both this and the game notes, and trying to think of icons for both that don't conflict. I sidestepped that however and just turned notes into a subsection, as you can see. The particular thing that spurred me to finish it was finding <a href="https://zonelets.net/">Zonelets</a>, a little blog template thingy that isn't too different from doing it all manually but just convenient enough to get me started. It does mean that I'm still dependent on JavaScript though, but that should be okay in all but some edge cases of people disabling it specifically. Oh also I fixed the icon loading issue shortly after writing the last entry, there are secret invisible versions of the icon gifs on every page to force them to load earlier, which is inelegant but functional!<br><br>Unsure if I have other stuff to say currently; I'm in the middle of Game-A-Week at the moment which is going quite smoothly. I might write something up about it if anything interesting occurs. Oh and Starbound mods! I recently published my first "big" mod, Emi's Fabulous Fishatorium (which was supposed to be "Fantabulous" but it was too long for the item tooltip), and people seem to like it which is cool. I have lots of Starbound mods which I feel like I should include in my links page given my Modrinth page is there, but it would just be a link to my Steam Workshop profile which feels different, somehow. <br><br>Also RSS stuff! I haven't implemented it yet and am considering it but I'm not entirely sure yet, including unsure if there's a nicer way than updating it manually every time.</p>
