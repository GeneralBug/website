                    As an exercise intended to improve my own design abilities by analysing other games, I started writing these little "review" things when I play a game (though I don't want them to be reviews, some get more "review-y" than others). They aren't really meant for others, so some of them are very rambly and possibly incomprehensible, so read them at your own risk.

                    Weirdly fun. At first the requirements for adequate level completion where a bit obtuse beyond the basic ‚Äúclean the blood‚Äù, and I‚Äôm not sure I would have figured it out without reading a guide (like stacking the boxes in the appropriate loading zone and using the laser welder thing on bullet holes). Also the lighting (even with a lamp) can be absolutely abysmal (which I get is a part of the aesthetic but it is still annoying). Also the physics can be a quite buggy, in that sort of early teenies Skyrim-y sort of way, though it matters more here since most of the game is manipulating physics objects. ALSO, interestingly, this is the first time I‚Äôve gotten motion sickness from a game; turning on the big UI circle thing helps, so maybe it‚Äôs caused by the lack of other UI elements?

                    A very interesting and fun concept! I don‚Äôt like explaining basic game information in these generally, but given that I‚Äôm now publishing them and this is an obscure romhack, I will; this is a roguelite Pokemon game where you go through a Slay-the-Spire-esque map and go into encounters (routes, rest stops, trainer battles, etc.) and fight a gym leader at the end of each segment, then eventually the elite four and champion with your little Nuzlocke team. It‚Äôs quite hard, and I‚Äôve have yet to reach the end, but quite fun. Each section has a level cap that you reach almost immediately so as to remove the need to grind, and healing (outside of healing rest stops) costs exponentially more each time you do before each ‚Äúboss‚Äù. The metaprogression is also interesting; as well as money for progress and achievements (of which there seem to be many) you eventually unlock the safari zone where you can catch anything you‚Äôve caught previously, including a high shiny chance if you found a shiny in a run. You can only take one Pokemon into a run, which resets when you end a run (to the state it was in when you started, so you can still apply TMs and stuff in the hub). It also has lots of options which I didn‚Äôt fiddle with too much, but you seem to be able to customise it a lot.

                    This is an interesting one; despite being a shitpost mod, it‚Äôs actually really high-effort in terms of both execution and content. It‚Äôs redistribution of Pikmin abilities feels nicely balanced. For example, Moyai üÖ±Ô∏èikmin (replacement of purples) are heavy for the purposes of weight puzzles, and ‚Äúbonk‚Äù when thrown, dealing extra damage and a momentary stun. This makes them still very useful in general and in niche situations (weight stuff), but not so powerful as to trivialise almost all combat like their vanilla counterparts. The ‚Äútrolling‚Äù mechanic is also very interesting, more so than the vanilla flower system; the three stages of flower growth, which grant slightly better walk/carry speed and damage at each stage in vanilla are replaced with three new states. Normal leaf üÖ±Ô∏èikmin, which are fast enough to keep up with you, the new ‚Äúbud‚Äù stage of ‚ÄúSonic‚Äù üÖ±Ô∏èikmin, which as far as I know only improves carry speed, but by a ton, and ‚Äútrolled‚Äù üÖ±Ô∏èikmin, which are acquired the ways you would normally get flowers, are completely useless, being agonisingly slow and weak, and are given a really weird floaty throw arch. This incentivises plucking üÖ±Ô∏èikmin quickly to avoid troll growth and turns nectar into an obstacle, and withering blowhogs (or whatever the equivalent was called in this) into a helpful utility. Overall, a very interesting take and worth a try, if you can stomach the Youtube poop.

                    Amazing visuals all around! The gradual build up of SCP stuff is cool, but the payoff was disappointing. The chair being a spooky ghost wasn‚Äôt mentioned in any of the notes (that I found) and it was apparently quite easy to extinguish.

                    A good game! Regular updates have added a fair amount of upgrades and stuff, where I would have said there weren‚Äôt very many before. Though I often felt towards the end of a run that unless I was specifically avoiding certain upgrades I tended to have lots of the same stuff. Certain builds also just feel straight up better than others, though I don‚Äôt know how you could avoid that without making everything the same or something. The art style is great, but projectiles can sometimes get lost in the noise, which is exacerbated by the small colour palette.

                    Really fun, if somewhat repetitive, multiplayer game! The digging mechanics are fun, the music is good, all that good stuff. While the game does feature a seasonal ‚Äúbattle pass‚Äù thing, it seems fairly tame? I can‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs meaningfully impacted my enjoyment. Still a bit unsavoury.

                    This makes Sword and Shield look good. While theoretically better, the numerous asinine design choices (no scaling on badges leading to a ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù order despite being able to do them in any order, so the latter half of the game becomes trivial, for example) and the inexcusable bugs and glitches make THIS the worst game in the series! Maybe if they patch the bugs (which I doubt they will; so far the only meaningful fix was a duplication exploit) it‚Äôll be at least better than Sword and Shield. Having said that, I still enjoyed it and I like lots of the new Pokemon, I guess? The music is pretty good, as usual.

                    I really like the Minish-cappy art style, and the emphasis on exploration was awesome; it rarely felt like I was moving in the intended direction but was still finding cool and interesting things. The lack of traditional ‚Äúdungeons‚Äù as one would expect of a Zelda-like worked well, I think. My main complaints are twofold; death felt entirely consequential, as you‚Äôd usually just get kicked to the start of the screen you were currently on, so there wasn‚Äôt any incentive to not just run past enemies, and making revive potions felt pointless. Also, and more substantially, the hitboxes for most stuff felt VERY janky. Though in their defence, I played most of the game with the lower hit invincibility on, which likely exacerbated the issue, and I expect it‚Äôs more a result of the engine they used.

                    It‚Äôs built on the same base as the first game so there wasn‚Äôt much new, but the level design was better, and felt different. It might have just been that I was more used to it by the time I played this one, but the levels seemed more designed about speedrunning, more about gliding through them to the end in cool and fancy ways. Beside the shift, they felt generally more interesting, which might have been a result of this or just general improvements in the developers skills; it‚Äôs hard to say. There also seemed to be even less spooky stuff; maybe I just misinterpreted the intent of the original as spooky, but there was basically nothing beside one big face that pops up on one of the water levels. Overall an improvement upon the original.

                    Not a great deal to say, it‚Äôs very good. Great visuals and sound, and interesting level design. For some reason it really hated my controller so I had to use keyboard and mouse, but the controls were fine once I got use to them. Also fewer spookems than I was expecting; it was more of a slight backdrop contrasting the colourful presentation rather than a horror game or anything, which was unexpected but maybe better? Hard to say.

                    A breath of fresh air! Despite being a spinoff, this is probably the best Pokemon game (at least in awhile, if not ever). I love the gameplay loop of just going around and throwing shit, which reminds me a lot of the Minecraft mod Pixelmon. When you think about it, these two projects are quite similar in concept; trying to translate a turn-based linear RPG adventure game into a more open and free-form one, but Pixelmon falls a bit flat in integrating the Pokemon meaningfully into the existing Minecraft gameplay and providing the player with any direction or incentives beyond ‚Äúcatch the cool thing you want‚Äù. PLA utilises Pokemon in all of it‚Äôs systems whoever, including resource collection and transport, as well as having goals beyond simply plot, making it far more compelling. Of course, they had the advantage of being about to design and build the game from scratch, but still. My main issues with PLA are;

                        <li>
                        It‚Äôs very ugly in both execution and art direction, though that‚Äôs pretty par for the course when it comes to Pokemon
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        It got a bit grindy near the end, having to stand around waiting for space-time rifts to catch some of the rarer stuff like fossils, though this can be worked around with trading
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Lack of meaningful multiplayer; literally only trading, though the bag recovery thing is a fun concept
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Most of the menus have some sort of issue, like lack of sorting. For example, It would have been nice to be able to pin Pokedex entries so that you don‚Äôt have to navigate back to it every time you check another one

                    What a bizarre product. Unlike previous ‚Äúremakes‚Äù, which are considered among the best games in the series, BDSP are more like glorified ports, with virtually no meaningful changes taken from Platinum and only a few meaningful differences to the originals, beside graphics (which are strangely just ‚Äú3D-ified‚Äù versions of the original sprites). On a positive note; the changes to the underground are good, with the dens containing the only interesting geometry in the game, the massive speed issues were fixed (though you could argue that was carried over from Platinum), and the Pokemon league was actually really fun to fight with the increase in difficulty. The HM system is reasonable too. However, the cons far outweigh all of that. The National Dex is limited once again, though it excludes stuff like Sylveon and (I believe) regional forms, which is one of those things that feels like it is only like because of some misplaced dedication to preserving the originals (I‚Äôm surprised they even included Fairy typing). The team-wide EXP-share isn‚Äôt toggle-able, and affection (which would only ‚Äúneed‚Äù to be included to evolve Sylveon) is TIED TO FRIENDSHIP (this is dumb). Also, technical issues. The game features many soft-locks and duplication glitches, though I‚Äôve been lucky enough to avoid them. The collsion on lots of the geometry is just fucked; sometimes as a product of vealous addherence to the original tile-based layouts, and elsewhere (the undergournd dens) just actually fucked. The D-pad controls are also broken; they‚Äôve obviously coded it using a flat if statement, as certain directions have clear priority over others, making it pretty much unusable for anything beside minor corrections around the afforementioned fucked collision. Also berry watering is broken, with random berries getting watered, but sometimes not, as they only appear watered, so you have to manually water each if you want proper yields, which is exacerbated by the removal of the original walking-sideways system. My theory is that Legends Arceus was originally intended to be the gen four remakes, but they got a bit carried away with it, but still wanted something, so they just pawned it off to ILCA, and maybe enforced strict creative limitations? It‚Äôd be interesting to know if the ‚Äúfaithfulness‚Äù was their idea or not. Now, having said all of that, I did still enjoy the game; at the end of the day, it‚Äôs still Pokemon. I understand Platinum is better than BDSP in basically every way, so play that instead. On a tangential note, I just realised that they stopped using the ‚Äúversion‚Äù sub-heading thing in gen 6.

                    This just happens to be a combination of my two favourite aesthetics; overgrown cityscapes and low-res 3D textures. It is so fucking gourgous, I can‚Äôt even begin to descibe it. Interestingly, the game starts out pretty routine, but as it goes on you actually have to consider your ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù to be able to pass levels, which I would be fine with either way; at worst, I find I need to add more to a scene that I‚Äôm already satisfied with. The plant growth physics are amazing and awesome and I just love this game so much.

                    While I generally think it‚Äôs pretty fun and interesting, I‚Äôve found it generally devolves into irreperable traffic issues just destroying everything.

                    Really really really cool! I‚Äôve only played Fusion and the NES original before (both of which I also liked), so I‚Äôm not sure how it generally compares, but It was really good. Very good looking too, and at a nice difficulty. That said, the controls are really bonkers; they‚Äôre trying to do far too much with a standard control pad, and so have to set up this really weird and obtuse control scheme to fit everything in, and it can feel very clunky and bad, especially when quick and precise actions are needed. I also got annoyed at times where I needed to do lots of backtracking, especially when you get into an area you can only leave from in a certain direction, forcing you to circle right around the entire map again, though the map being clear and showing stuff like breakable blocks and uncollected pickups helped considerably. I probably should have written this a month ago when I was playing the bulk of it, as I left it for a bit and only just came back to finish off the final boss.

                    While I don‚Äôt have much experience with the stuff this is based upon (closest I‚Äôve come would be Half-Life) I think this is very good! I like the N64-y art direction and the level design is also great. On that note, I did often find myself questioning whether I was going in the correct direction or through an extra area, though it never hindered my progress. I only got stuck once; after the first bossfight, I couldn‚Äôt find the little hole in the wall and had to reference a walkthrough. I really like the simplicity of it, which reminded me a lot of Half-Life, as mentioned before. One odd thing was the crossbow, which allowed for a great deal of cheese (such as basically bypassing the horse boss) and making the soup work on bosses. The atmosphere was great, with some really good spooky sections.

                    Most of my observations are comparisons to the first game. I prefer the magic system in this one, though I didn‚Äôt use it much. The FP (‚Äúfunny points‚Äù) system, while less unique, seems better at facilitating consistent usage (i.e. less constant backtracking to replenish uses). They also did away with the old durability, which is nice since it felt like a non-issue. My main complaint if the level design, with the map being extremely linear, to the point where it feels weird to even call it a Metroidvania. You get small clusters of connectedness within a given area, with single connections to each of the next parts. Having the ability to warp around between bonfires from the beginning, while convenient and nice, feels like it takes away a measure of connection to each area. I feel like I explore somewhere, reach the next bonfire, and never have any reason to go there again. These combined make the game feel more ‚Äúempty‚Äù, I suppose. Perhaps if you could only warp to specific bonfires? Also, bonfire placement is sometimes really weird. It felt quite generous, but often you‚Äôd get bonfires that felt right next to one another, especially the Dragonslayer Armour and Grand Archives bonfires, which are just comically close. Of course, all the other stuff is good; combat and visuals and bosses and all that are superb. ALSO, I found it odd that, as with to Dark Souls, the final boss was pretty underwhelming, considering the whole point is the big fancy hard bosses.

                    Very cute, and very nice mechanics used well! I only got stuck at one part near the end, where you have to get a lightbulb up to a platform while you‚Äôre on a moving platform, which was mostly frustrating because of the wait between attempts. Also, the lighting bubbles not also being low-res pixel stuff is mildly disappointing. I really like that you can so back and collect the little token things after completing all the levels, but it would be nice if that were clearer from the beginning, as I restarted the first level to fine the one bean I missed.

                    Holy scabolly, this do be a spicy meat-a-balle! Very good visuals and audio, very nice story and characters and stuff, clever use of the medium to enhance said story; everything! For example, the stealing minigame thing was an interesting application of the existing ‚Äúhand‚Äù stuff and effectively conveyed the tension of the scenario. While it was longer than I expected, it felt far too short by the end. I‚Äôm interested to know how much your decisions actually impact the events and outcome of the story, but I also don‚Äôt want to check for other endings and stuff lest I decide to replay it in the near future (which is likely).

                    As with Carrion, a very short, well-polished little game. Very good atmosphere as well.

                    Carrion is really good. Not too much specific to say. The best part is probably the overall feel of the game. The creature feels cool to control, the visual effects like the screen shakes, lighting and gore globs are amazing, and the sound is super punchy (especially with the shaking on that gatling gun) and good. It‚Äôs also really short, but in a good way; it would have likely gotten stale had they tried to stretch it out too much.

                    I‚Äôve heard a lot of good things about Terraria, but having finally played it, I definitely prefer Starbound. I think it‚Äôs not bad overall, but has lots of little things that feel annoying or unpolished, which remind me that I could be playing Starbound instead. Firstly, the difficulty spike after beating the Wall of Flesh felt very extreme; suddenly, all my cool gear is completely useless, monsters that can all but one-shot me are everywhere, and the corruption is immediately right on my doorstep. This isn‚Äôt an inherently bad idea, but I was unprepared and it felt quite unfair. Next, the inventory system feels weirdly cumbersome. It might be that the icons are too small, or they all look too indistinct from one another, I‚Äôm not really sure. It just feels off, somehow. I do greatly appreciate the quick stack button, though. Lastly is the crafting system, which is probably the worst implementation I‚Äôve seen. So, crafting is in a small list bellow the inventory, and new recipes become available when you stand next to certain objects in the world (which can be literally anything). However, recipes only appear if you have all the required ingredients, and you can only check recipes by talking to the guide and placing an ingredient for that recipe in this little slot (that I never would have noticed had it not been pointed out to me). It‚Äôs really dumb and annoying, and usually requires me to have a wiki open on my second screen. All that said, I like the density of content and the concept of the boss system. The achievement telling you what to aim for next in the menu is also a great idea that helped me considerably. I definitely prefer Starbound though, as it does all the stuff I complained about far better, and has a few other advantages like nicer controls/‚Äùinteraction systems‚Äù (placing tiles in the background, for example), and I prefer the more ‚Äúfirm‚Äù lore and the general concept of space exploration much more. I should also note that I haven‚Äôt tried mods yet, which could very well fix everything and make it amazing.

                    Worst games in the series, hands down. Clearly very rushed, with bland graphics, non-existent challenge, basically no story (even by Pok√©mon standards), no postgame beside the DLC (which feels very tacked on), uninteresting gimmick, and of course, dexit. I feel like they had lots of great ideas, but just half-assed them all. I love the soccer-league aesthetic, but the gym challenges themselves feel completely detached from it, with only the leader battles even happening in the stadium. The wild area is a great idea, but they needed to go all-in and replace routes entirely; we just ended up with a big empty field with nothing to do, and bland, linear routes with no reason to ever return to. To me, it seems like Gamefreak really doesn‚Äôt want to make Pok√©mon games anymore, but can‚Äôt not, given how absurdly profitable they are. It‚Äôs just really disappointing. All that said, I still did enjoy the game quite a bit; it‚Äôs still Pok√©mon at the end of the day, and if you like the core gameplay, you‚Äôll probably still have fun with it. The music is amazing as always, and I like lots of the new Pok√©mon and the Gigantamax designs. Don‚Äôt bother unless you know you already really like Pok√©mon.

                    I‚Äôd previously only played the demo for Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate on the 3DS and didn‚Äôt really like it, so I was a bit sceptical about it. However, I‚Äôve found myself enjoying it a lot. It‚Äôs pretty repetitive, and can get quite grindy if you want all the best gear, but it annoys me far less than I expected. The core gameplay is just really fun. Early on, I had a bit of trouble with the controls, as my brain kept trying to think of it like Dark Souls, though it‚Äôs not similar beyond vague aesthetics (if that makes sense). On the topic of controls, they‚Äôre really weird and annoying, with far too many combinations doing various moves or controlling different menus and shit, and I wish there were a way to simplify it all; for example, by default, to scroll through items, you have to hold L and press the D-pad until you reach what you want, but that also brings up this action wheel thing controlled by the right stick, disabling camera controls (I‚Äôve accidentally wasted potions with this thing far too many times). Crafting equipment is okay, though the menu for the smith is a bit obtuse, and it‚Äôs annoying that you can‚Äôt see what an item needs until you‚Äôve ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù it, meaning it‚Äôs hard to properly plan ahead. So basically, I like the game, but it has lots of little annoying things that don‚Äôt detract too much. Play it with friends.

                    As a kid, one of the first video games I played was Silver, and, while I had no idea what I was doing, I loved it. So, I bought Crystal when it came to the 3DS, and I love it! I‚Äôm not sure I can recommend it though, since it was far from perfect even at launch, and a lot of the shittier stuff has been exaggerated by age. The level scaling is terrible, with wild encounters capping at about level 30 outside of Victory Road and Mt. Silver (which you can only reach after beating the Kanto league), which making leveling up extremely grindy as the game goes on. Some of the mechanics are pretty fucked too, like only being able to carry 10 unique items in your main pocket, not being able to see what moves do without a wiki, and many of the day-of-the-week based events being tedious to reach. Also the roaming legendaries; wowsers. While great for its time and a massive step up from Red and Blue, I‚Äôd only suggest playing it today if you‚Äôre either nostalgic or curious. Play HG/SS instead.

                    It‚Äôs really fucking good, dude. After 3D All Stars came out, I decided to finally play through all the 3D Mario-s, and Odyssey is easily the best. The controls feel great, the hat mechanic is super cool and well utilised. One major difference I noticed is the lack of super annoying, shitting bullshit parts that previous titles have sprinkled throughout, like the Chuckster thing in Sunshine. I can only think of two parts that even approached that level of frustration, and both were postgame, completionist areas. A testament to the design is also that many parts that should be super shitty and annoying are somehow not, most notably the sheep herding (in the overworld areas) and the face puzzle things. So yeah, the hype is justified, Odyssey is awesome.

                    A fun little Zelda-y puzzle game. It only has three items for you to use, but it explores each of their mechanics and interactions very well and interestingly. I also appreciate that the map shows areas you‚Äôve not completed yet (once you find the upgrade for it). The game looks good too, though the music was underwhelming, and felt more like background noise. It‚Äôs short, so no reason not to give it a try!

My brain just doesn‚Äôt run fast enough to figure out what to do between the fast beats. I also had this problem with the Cadence of Hyrule demo, which sucks even more because of how much more cool stuff appears to be in it. That said, the visuals are very good and the music is excellent (as you‚Äôd imagine from a music-based game). The soundtrack is on Spotify, and I‚Äôd absolutely recommend it.

                    Baldur‚Äôs Gate is one of those big classic games people talk about that‚Äôs influenced tons of stuff coming after it. However, I played about 4 hours, put it down and have no real desire to pick it back up. Most of my complaints can be attributed to its age; this is also the first game of this type I‚Äôve played, so some of it may just be that I don‚Äôt like the genre. The controls, movement and dialogue all feel very crusty and unappealing. The only reason I‚Äôd consider continuing is to see the story through, though it seems to be pretty standard, so I can‚Äôt see that happening. Overall, pretty meh.

                    Factorio is one of those games that I‚Äôll start playing at noon, look over at the clock an hour later and it‚Äôs 2 in the morning. Troubleshooting issues in your production lines can be endlessly frustrating, and having an outpost be overrun by alien bugs feels crushing, and yet I continue to persist, laying conveyers and repairing walls, automating the construction of every little crafting component, not because its used for anything important, but simply because I can. My interest in this ‚Äúautomation‚Äù genre or whatever you call it originated with modded Minecraft, and I can say that this definitely scratches that itch (and is far less likely to crash and corrupt my save).

                    I played this as a kid, so obligatory ‚Äúnostalgia warning‚Äù or whatever. It‚Äôs one of my favourite games of all time, and it holds up incredibly well. It‚Äôs an amazing sequel, refining the mechanics of the first game (which feel pretty clunky going back after the future games) and expanding the content to near perfection. I‚Äôm struggling to articulate just how awesome this game is. The bosses are cool and interesting, the music is amazing, the treasures are cool and fun to collect. On that note, many of the treasures are product placement, like the Duracell battery you get on the first day, but I think this is actually kind of cool and gives a nice ‚Äúgrounding‚Äù in the post-apocalyptic setting (though it seemed like an odd choice; who is their target audience?). My only complaints are that some of the caves are a bit funky (why is there a perfectly preserved living room under this swamp?) and some mechanics are still a little scuffed, like Pikmin drinking nectar, or how you throw Pikmin with extra momentum when running but only sometimes. Overall, play Pikmin 2 now it‚Äôs amazing I swear.

                    First of all, it‚Äôs a Pikmin game, so it‚Äôs obviously amazing and you would play it right now. I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs enough of an improvement from the Wii U version that you should play this one instead (though the old one is much cheaper, if you‚Äôre really desperate and strapped for cash. Again, it‚Äôs Pikmin, so it‚Äôs good). There are lots of control options in this one, which is always a pleasant surprise when Nintendo does it. Personally, I prefer a normal controller without gyro, but you should definitely try the different ways out. The changes to the charge mechanic (allowing you to charge your selected type in the direction you‚Äôre facing or at the thing you‚Äôre locked onto) make it better than the original, but it still doesn‚Äôt feel like it replaces the old swarm. The new side story stuff is nice, even if they are just glorified mission maps. The difficulty options are interesting, though even on Ultra-Spicy, I never had trouble doing everything I needed in reasonable time, and it‚Äôs still by far the easiest entry in the series. If you never played it on Wii U, definitely get this one, and if you did, get it if you really liked it and want more. Play the demo either way, just in case.

The only part I remembered having an issue with are these two ‚ÄúSimon-says‚Äù, memorise-the-sequence-and-repeat-it sections, which I always despise. Thankfully one was optional, but please, PLEASE never put that shit in any game ever, they are not fun. Everything else was great though, so still definitely worth playing! On a side note, I noticed the dungeons were generally used more linear, sequence-of-puzzle style layouts, rather than the more circular-y layouts from most Zeldas; not a good or bad thing, just interesting.

The world isn‚Äôt that big, and once you‚Äôve got all the slimes, there isn‚Äôt too much to do beyond the lab stuff. While I get it‚Äôs probably contradictory to their design goals, I felt the automation with the bee robots (which are also adorable) to be rather underwhelming and would have liked to see more.

                    Probably the best platformer I‚Äôve ever played. Simple controls expanded upon with tons of interesting and intuitive mechanics, each of which feel amazing to use in the masterfully crafted levels. Making each screen a checkpoint allows them to make individual challenges very challenging without being frustrating, allowing the game to be very difficult but forgiving, which, as someone who sucks, is a very good thing. The presentation is amazing, with beautiful pixel art and lighting effects, as well as an amazing soundtrack. I‚Äôm extremely jealous that I will never be able to make something on such a level as this.

                    Very fun puzzle platformer with an interesting idea that is explored fully without overstaying its welcome. I played the switch version, and my only complaint is the colour wheel can sometimes be a bit finicky, especially when you need to change quickly. It‚Äôs a small issue though, and I can‚Äôt think of a better way to do it. Very good!
